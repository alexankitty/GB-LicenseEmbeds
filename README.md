# GB-LicenseEmbeds
Quick and dirty repo for license embeds on gamebanana designed to mimic how github presents its licensing summaries.  
Example of how they look.

# Usage
Open the html file of the license you want to use, copy and paste the contents into the source tab of GB's license area. Make sure you also check the license check list and set appropriately.

# Other licenses
If you need another license type added that github has a summary for, let me know or make a PR and update an existing one.

## License Shields
All of the license shields used are sourced from [Markdown License Badges](https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba) thank you lukas-h for making these.

## Legal Disclaimer
All of the licensing in this repo is provided as-is with no recommendations on which licensing you should pick. It is still your responsibility to do the research on the license type that best fits your project, and to consult an attorney as needed.
