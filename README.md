# GB-LicenseEmbeds
Quick and dirty repo for license embeds on GameBanana, designed to mimic how GitHub presents its licensing summaries.  

### Example

# Usage
* Open the `html` file of the license you would like to use in a text editor and copy its contents.
* In GameBanana, open the **Edit** page for your submission.
* Select the **Ownership** tab and scroll down to the **License** area.
* Select the **Source** tab in the **License** area and paste the contents of the `html` file.
* Configure the **License Checklist** appropriately, then save your submission.

# Other licenses
If you need another license type added that GitHub has a summary for, let me know or make a PR and update an existing one.
